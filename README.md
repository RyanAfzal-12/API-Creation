This project is a Web API built using the ASP.NET API Framework. It fetches data from an external API and processes it before presenting
the information on a website using the MVC architecture. The API exposes endpoints that allow users to retrieve real-time data,
ensuring seamless interaction with external data sources. The functionality is tested via Postman, making it easy to verify the correctness and reliability of the API. 
This project demonstrates how to consume and display external data through a well-structured Web API.
